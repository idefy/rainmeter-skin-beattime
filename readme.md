Swatch Internet Beat time skin for Rainmeter
============================================

version 1.0.0

What is it ?
------------

A simple skin that implements Swatch Internet Beat time.
Internet Time exists so that we do not have to think about timezones. For
example, if a New York web-supporter makes a date for a chat with a cyber friend
in Rome, they can simply agree to meet at an "@ time" - because internet time
is the same all over the world.

For more information see [swatch official page](http://www.swatch.com/en_ca/internet-time/).
